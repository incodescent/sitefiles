			<h2>Christian McBride & Inside Straight at Stanford</h2>
<p>Stanford Lively Arts presents two-time Grammy winner, Christian McBride this Saturday night at Dinkelspiel Auditorium on the campus of Stanford University. In this latest Lively Arts performance—following on last season’s sold-out tribute to Herbie Hancock—DownBeat 2009 Readers Poll–winning bassist Christian McBride re.turns at the helm of his acclaimed acoustic ensemble, Inside Straight. In this evening, McBride is joined in this night of “hard swing-to-bluesy groove tunes” by some of the most in-demand players on the scene today: saxophonist Jaleel Shaw, vibist Warren Wolf, Jr. (featured on the group's 2009 debut disc, Kind of Brown), pianist Christian Sands, and drummer Ulysses Owens.</p>

			<h2>Roy Hargrove returns to Berkeley</h2>
<p>At 45, trumpeter Roy Hargrove is a mid-career master, a tried and tested horn star who’s fruitfully investigated Cuban clave, R&B, hard bop, African soul, hip hop and post-bop. Since emerging in the late 1980s as a preternaturally gifted player with boundless technique and bountiful charisma, Hargrove has led a series of striking ensembles. When most brass players his age were sowing wild oats and blasting high notes, the Dallas-raised prodigy was soaking up musical wisdom from his elders, tempering his blues-drenched swagger with a beatific lyricism. </p>

			<h2>Vijay Iyer Trio at Yoshi's Oakland</h2>
<p>An adventurous pianist and composer, Vijay Iyer not only stretches boundaries but has long reached well beyond the vocabulary of jazz. He leads a genre-crossing quartet with saxophone phenom Rudresh Mahanthappa; he’s recorded with poet Mike Ladd; and he is also part of the visionary collective Fieldwork. An artist with a relentlessly searching intellect  and awe-inspiring technique, Iyer was voted #1 Rising Star Jazz Artist in the DownBeat 2009 Critic’s Poll and  his trio recording Historicity was named #1 Top Jazz Album of 2009 by The New York Times.</p>
